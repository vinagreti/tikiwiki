Tiki Custom Files
-----------------
Part of the planned file and directory revamp, this directory will eventually contain all custom files specific to your Tiki install.

I.E. Custom themes, JavaScript, plugins and configuration files.

Currently any custom PHP code required for your site can now be added to _custom/lib/setup/custom.php.

N.B. this directory and all files within it should NOT be web writable.

Work in progress for Tiki 18, more fundemental changes planned for Tiki 19 in 2018.
